# Autonomous Audit Ledger — 2026-08-04

## Execution identity

- branch: `agent/workspace-47-autonomous-20260803`
- base: `9c99bbfb36e13f88231d56001ccef8c4cbbce128`
- worktree: `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/workspace-47-autonomous-20260803`
- task active-time budget: 43,200,000 ms
- generation active-time budget: 2,400,000 ms
- manual/device/credential operations: prohibited

## Baseline evidence

- Gradle: 143 actionable tasks; Debug unit 509/509 and QA unit 509/509 passed
  with zero failures, errors, or skips; `lintDebug`, `lintQa`, `assembleDebug`,
  `assembleQa`, and `assembleQaAndroidTest` passed.
- Python: 94 tests passed with one environmental hardlink skip.
- Go: `go test ./... -count=1`, `go vet ./...`, and relay build passed.
- Android artifact verification passed.
- Release without private signing inputs failed closed as required.
- The relay build produced one untracked local binary; it was deleted after its
  successful build and the worktree returned clean.
- No APK was installed or launched and no portal was opened.

## Queue discipline

Findings are appended with evidence, severity, autonomous feasibility, exact
sub-plan path, focused/full verification, commit SHA, push result, and residual
manual gate. A finding is not marked complete from reasoning alone.

## Initial audit queue

1. Reconcile residual items and incomplete claims in
   `docs/handoffs/NEXT_CHAT_HANDOFF.md` with current source and tests.
2. Review current Kotlin compiler warnings around exposed network transport types
   and decide whether they indicate a real API boundary defect.
3. Review QA-only portal profiles and compatibility documents for exact status and
   release-registry consistency.
4. Continue the fresh security/privacy trust-boundary audit across certificate,
   storage, logging, WebView and signing boundaries.

## Queue reconciliation — generation 1

- The DNS-executor determinism item was stale in this ledger. The current baseline
  already contains `DirectTestExecutorService`, explicit test-owned DNS executors
  for JVM transports, and the completed evidence recorded in the security roadmap,
  test report and durable handoff. No runtime-network change was repeated.
- The AEAT F-03 physical continuation is intentionally not an autonomous action:
  device control, certificate use and portal authentication are prohibited in this
  audit cycle. Its existing `VERIFIED_CONTRACT / QA_ONLY` status is unchanged.
- The exposed-network-type suppression remains an open architecture review item;
  no visibility/API mutation has been made yet.

## Finding G1-01 — QA WebView remote debugging boundary

**Reproduction.** `TrustedJuntaWebView` called
`setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(BuildConfig.DEBUG)`. The QA build inherits from
`debug`, explicitly remains debuggable, and its generated BuildConfig showed
`DEBUG=true`. QA is the controlled acceptance variant used by existing real-portal
validation, so the broad debug flag also enabled application-wide WebView DevTools
for that variant.

**Remediation.** `ENABLE_WEBVIEW_CONTENTS_DEBUGGING` is now an explicit build
policy: default `false`, ordinary developer `debug=true`, `qa=false`, and
`release=false`. `TrustedJuntaWebView` consumes only that field; QA debuggability,
portal profiles, origin/TLS/signing policy and certificate behavior are unchanged.

**TDD evidence.** The new CI policy test first failed because the explicit field
was absent. An initial loose matcher then exposed a malformed intermediate edit
(debug carried both values and QA lacked its explicit override); that result was
rejected. The test was tightened to parse each build block independently, observed
RED on the malformed state, and passed only after the minimal corrected policy.

**Fresh verification.** Debug and QA JVM suites each passed 509/509 with zero
failures/errors/skips. `lintDebug`, `lintQa`, `assembleDebug`, `assembleQa` and
`assembleQaAndroidTest` passed in one Gradle invocation (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, 140
actionable tasks); lint contained 0 errors and 27 warnings per variant. Python
passed 95 tests with one environmental hardlink skip. Go test/vet/build passed.
Android artifact verification passed. Release without private signing inputs was
rejected fail-closed as required. Generated BuildConfig evidence is `true` for
Debug and `false` for QA; release does not generate BuildConfig because its signing
gate rejects configuration before that stage, and the source policy test pins its
explicit `false` branch.

APK SHA-256 after the remediation:

- Debug: `2f45274f105faac67c5cedd3272278cad1a7b77bae592730fecea3786da7b4c4`;
- QA: `d326174c55a470f5a857574342ebad9dd0e6a68e82768f95c061e895d4749e62`;
- QA AndroidTest: `6e41e3c8c41775194681a3a7b41f999422cb82b48b59ff3aa19c3923c6db252b`.

No APK was installed or launched; no device control, portal interaction,
certificate operation, credential use or signature occurred.
